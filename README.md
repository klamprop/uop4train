# ForgeBox
FORGEBox is an experimental prototype platform enabling Interactive courses on top of FIRE resources.

FORGEBox is a technology created and supported by the FP7 FORGE project. FORGEBox is the component that interconnects learning interactive content with FIRE resources. It comprises a set of services that will provide and host for example the interactive content of widgets, and interface with the FIRE resources via well-known FIRE APIs or with the Fed4FIRE portal. LMSs, eBooks and any future element that wishes to consume FORGE content, will need to discover reference points of widgets and Lab Courses descriptions. FORGEBox instantiations can provide the host of such interactive content.
